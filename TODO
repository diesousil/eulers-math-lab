- Change clean script with this solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34650527/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-package-json

- Ensure functionDictionary has valid entries (maybe should be dinamically generated, or even created on build)

- Expression validation system
    - Validate input syntax before running the solver

- Equation solver

- Inequation solver

- System of equations solving

- Math function definition
    - Plot 2d function
    - Plot 3d function
    - Derivative, Integration

- Then start to test algorithms to search max and minimuns for a second phase
