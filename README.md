    This Node.js application serves as a mathematical laboratory, facilitating the creation and testing of algorithms for practical mathematical investigations. Currently, it processes mathematical expressions by accepting them as input and providing their solutions whenever feasible.

    Jest tests have been implemented for expressions that already work in this current version.
