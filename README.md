# Euler's Math Lab
## From Diego Silva <diesousil@gmail.com>

    <p>This Node.js application serves as a mathematical laboratory, facilitating the creation and testing of algorithms for practical mathematical investigations. Currently, it processes mathematical expressions by accepting them as input and providing their solutions whenever feasible.</p>

    <p>Jest tests have been implemented for expressions that already work in this current version.</p>
